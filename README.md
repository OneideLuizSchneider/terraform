# terraform
\
Terraform is a great tool for provisioning infrastructure, easy to learn and understand.
\
\
To run this example you need to configure the AWS CLI or configure the AWS variables in your environment.
\
First, you need to init the Terraform, for that run this command:
```
terraform init
```
With this command you'll see what Terraform will change or created on AWS:
```
terraform plan
```
To apply these changes you need to run this command:
```
terraform apply
```
To destroy all changes just run this command:
```
terraform destroy
```
*make sure you are in the folder above.
